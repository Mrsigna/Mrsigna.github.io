    <h1>Ancient Origins</h1>
    <p>The history of apples traces back to ancient times, with their origins believed to lie in the region between the Caspian and the Black Sea. Wild apple trees, known as Malus sieversii, grew in this area and were initially dispersed by birds and animals, allowing the fruit to spread to surrounding regions. Early human civilizations began to notice the appeal and potential of these wild apples, leading to their cultivation and the start of the apple's journey through history.</p>
